Role,AAT Term,AAT LOD URI,Remarks
Artist,artists (visual artists),http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300025103,"Also used for ""authors"" (http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300025492) of books and writers of letters, and occasionally for ""makers"" (http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300251917) of non-art objects."
Associated Person/Institution,subjects (content of works),http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300404126,Used when a constituent is the subject of a non-portrait object (especially books and documents or letters)
Secondary Artist/Maker,artists (visual artists),http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300025103,"The AAT term has to be the same as for artist, though the role is very different. Secondary artists are constituents who are related to the creation of the work but did not actually make it, e.g. copies after, forgeries after, studios and foundries, publishers, former attributions, etc.  INCLUDING PREFIX IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE."
Sitter,sitters,http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300189844,"Straigtforward, except when we link the generic constituent ""non-portrait"" as the sitter--over 700 non-portrait objects are included with the NPG data; unfortunately not the same non-portrait objects that include constituents in the role of Associated Person/Institution. :( "
